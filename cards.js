            One of the reasons I love being a part of CUAir is its incredible team culture. CUAir is a student-run project team at Cornell University that works together to design, build, and operate an unmanned aerial system. Every summer, we compete in the annual international AUVSI SUAS competition, where our system demonstrates autonomous waypoint navigation, image processing, air delivery, and target recognition. Every member I've met on the team is passionate about the work we do and so genuinely happy to help their teammates. As someone who was a part of several teams in high school and is currently on Cornell's fencing team, I believe that kind of passion and support is so crucial to creating a successful and long-lasting team. 
            <br>
            <br>
            CUAir's active alumni network is evidence of the team's outstanding culture; it is full of people eager to pass on their knowledge and provide guidance to young undergrads, even years after leaving the team. I had the chance to chat with alumnus Brendan Quinn after he reached out to the team to pass along info about an internship position. We quickly struck up a conversation about computer science, CUAir, and my goal of learning front-end this summer. Having graduated in 2017 and worked as a software engineer, Brendan was well-equipped to offer some advice and guidance. He suggested several resources for learning front-end and recommended frameworks to look into. We also chatted about CUAir- me updating him on the latest progress, him reminiscing and sending us his moral support. Having such a strong alumni network encourages me to maintain the great culture we have and pass it forward to the people who join after me. I know that's what makes a great team.`

            Adam is an alumnus of the Cornell men's fencing team and works in private equity consulting. We met at the annual fencing team banquet and alumni weekend event in May and connected over my interest in CS and his experience working with software/tech companies. I knew I could learn a lot from him about understanding what I'd like to do career-wise and how I could get there. So, at the end of the weekend, I sent him an email and we set up a time to talk. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Adam offered valuable advice during our conversation, and I'm so appreciative of his time and his help. As a CS major with a business minor, I've always been interested in the integration of tech with our everyday lives and other disciplines. Adam's experiences gave me more insight into what that entails. He also connected me with a friend in product management who could give me another perspective on business and tech. What I found most eye-opening in our conversation was Adam's thoughtful advice for the career development process. We discussed the power of informational interviews and a major focus of career development: finding the job that fits your interests with a company's needs, rather than simply <em>a</em> job. Adam gave me tips on questions to ask, ideas to consider, and strategies for conveying my strengths while addressing my weaknesses. Trading stories and talking about the challenges of career development with a Cornell grad not much older than myself was enlightening, reassuring, and incredibly helpful. Exploring career paths and speaking with professionals can be intimidating, but I look forward to expanding my knowledge and worldview.

            desc: `&emsp; My primary focus this summer was becoming proficient in front-end web development, and then using those skills to work with one other member of CUAir to create a recruitment portal for our team's fall recruitment cycle. I made it my goal to learn the basics as soon as possible after finishing my spring semester and began looking for educational/practice resources online in May.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; This TUM edX Course, "Make Your Own App", was my first taste of HTML/CSS/JS and taught me the fundamentals via a project called ChatterApp: a mock messaging app that allows you to create different messaging channels, organize them by "favorited" and "un-favorited", and send messages. Working with HTML/CSS/JS on a tangible project, rather than isolated, short practice exercises, was incredibly helpful for my learning- I could see how different pieces of the code fit together, wrestle with challenges as they appeared while working on the project, and leave with
            a completed app that I could look back on and refer to when needed. Looking back on the project, I'm proud of the amount I was able to learn and apply in a week, but I also would have tidied up my code and tried to add some of my own features beyond the course instructions if I were to do it again. The course was a great first stepping stone in learning front-end. It set up the foundation I needed to work on several other online courses for JS, React, and TypeScript.`

The tutorial itself was a case of practical learning by doing, in which I learned about class components, function components, state, and passing props by implementing those concepts to create a tic-tac-toe game. As a result however, some instructions and explanations left me wondering how and why things worked the way they did, so I often looked to the documentation articles to read more about each idea. To test my understanding after finishing the tutorial, I also implemented some of the additional features suggested at the end of the tutorial, such as highlighting the winning column/row and displaying the location of each move.`

            While the edX course and React tutorial were great introductions to front-end, I still didn't feel entirely comfortable with the tools. I wanted more practice, so I looked into other resources and found Codecademy. Doing courses on Codecademy helped me become more familiar with using the concepts I had learned and dive into more depth with each of them. After working through courses on JavaScript, React, React testing, TypeScript, Git & GitHub, and responsive design, I felt much more confident in my ability to work on front-end projects.

            <a href="./projects.html#2">Adam</a> introduced me to Cody, a friend of his and the founder and Head of Business at Product Gym, an educational service for professionals looking to build a career in product management. He is also the Head of Product at Quadency, a cryptocurrency trading platform, and has extensive experience in product management (PM) and starting new businesses. PM as a career interests me because of its blend of technology and business, so I was eager to reach out to Cody and learn more about his work.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before meeting with Cody, I made sure to first do my research on product management and careers in the industry. It was surprising to learn about the breadth of responsibilities and knowledge a product manager could have. One of the reasons I chose to go to Cornell was because of its support for interdisciplinary learning. The intersection of business, design, and engineering that product managers deal with would let me continue interdisciplinary work beyond my undergraduate studies. Talking with Cody a few days later helped me see technology/engineering from a new perspective: that of an entrepreneur. Cody explained that he'd always been more interested in figuring out what had the most value or could make the most profit, rather than focusing on the "best" code or engineering. He also told me about his experiences founding multiple businesses and the challenge of scaling a start-up into a larger company. Our conversation led me to think about considerations and ideas I'd never focused on before, since most of my learning had centered around technical concepts in computer science. I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to talk with him and expand my understanding of entrepreneurship and product management.

            desc: `&emsp; The Human Performance Hackathon was a hackathon hosted by Entrepreneurship at Cornell and held in the NYC office of sponsoring company Next Jump. The event tested what small groups of participants could ideate, develop, and pitch as a product for improving human performance in less than 48 hours. Human performance broadly describes a person's behavior and effort as a result of social, physical, and mental factors. It is in many ways a "well-being" industry, in that a person's psychological, physical, and social well-being greatly impact their performance. As a result, there are a plethora of angles in which to tackle to challenge of improving human performance. My group, Dr. Chef, envisioned a solution to the complex and often overwhelming problem of trying to create and stick to a specific diet necessitated by a medical condition like diabetes or kidney disease. Our product would help people maintain their health and, as a result, perform at a higher level. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; The participants formed a diverse crowd made up of college students, graduate students, working professionals, and high schoolers. After an afternoon spent breaking the ice and introducing ourselves, two of my new acquaintances suggested the idea for Dr. Chef to myself and another new friend. We all loved the idea and saw huge potential for creating a positive impact on people's health. We each had different areas of expertise — two studying biology, one a supervisor at Starbucks, and myself in technology — but we all lacked previous hackathon experience, and I knew we'd need someone who understood the financial and business side of creating a product. So, I sought out Garrett, a business management undergrad I'd met earlier that day. By the end of dinner, the five of us had solidified as a team with a clear direction to work in.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; Over the next 36 hours, I learned so much more than I could ever expect about the design process, working as a team in a high-pressure environment, and creating a persuasive pitch. We first worked through a design process workshop that helped us jumpstart the brainstorming process and hone in on our problem and solution. Before beginning to work, I felt it was important to make sure we were all on the same page about our product's functionality, our target consumers, and what each of us needed to do. We decided to narrow our focus to type II diabetes for our pitch as a proof of concept, but we'd explain that our product would in reality serve a multitude of medical conditions. Our app would use user-provided medical information to suggest recipes and restaurant items that were "safe" to eat based on the user's condition. It would also allow users to track blood sugar levels (vital for monitoring diabetes) and send notifications for reminders and encouragement. As the day continued, we emphasized communicating with each other about new thoughts we had, obstacles that had come up, or help we needed. Strong communication helped us work together smoothly and efficiently. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; Several "mentors" —professionals and experts in a variety of fields— had been invited to the hackathon to help groups over the weekend. At the first team check-in with the mentors, we were blown away by their immediate interest. At least five different mentors came to our workstation to learn more about our product and provide feedback, including a doctor from the UK, two CrossFit trainers, a Michelin-star chef, and a Next Jump employee. Our team was buzzing with excitement and new ideas, which we debated, adjusted, and defined in a meeting after the mentors had left. After everything was settled, I turned to focus on my responsibility: a mockup of our app in Figma. As I developed the login page, profile, recipe list, and main dashboard, I considered what information we needed to receive and display, as well as how to make the design intuitive and easy to use. As the team pivoted to address obstacles when they came up through the day, my designs changed too. For example, we originally thought of using the Figma file as a live demo to click through the app, but later decided to instead use screenshots of the file and not risk a technical issue during the live pitch. This change forced me to re-evaluate what parts of the app were most important to display and how we would communicate the app's functionality through still images.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; At the end of the final morning, the organizers announced the prize winners, and our team was elated to find out we had won $500 as the most feedback-seeking team, voted by the mentors. One of the mentors even told us he would like to be formally involved if we continued to work on our product after the event. The whole weekend was an incredible learning experience in entrepreneurship, design, ideation, and teamwork. Over those two days, I was pushed to think about user interface, financial viability, competing companies, and other considerations I'd previously only had classroom experience with. I hope to bring what I've learned from this event to other work I do and hackathons I attend in the future.

            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; I started by sketching out my ideas on paper, considering layout, features, and structure. I then created wireframes in Figma and used Figma's prototype feature to simulate how a user would navigate the site. I picked out fonts and accent colors, and even drew a custom plant vector for the home page to complete the cozy yet clean theme. Coding the website itself was fairly straightforward, as the main purpose of the site is to display information, rather than work with complex user inputs or compute and analyze data. My favorite part of the project was working on the JS logic behind this projects page, particularly in implementing the sorting button functionality. The logic puzzles and problem-solving are what first drew me into studying computer science, and I'll always love the satisfaction of finding a solution to some software challenge.
            <br>
            <br>
            This website is still very much a work in progress, and there are many things I'd like to improve. One working idea is to use React components for the project/update cards to eliminate the need for hard-coded information in the HTML file and simplify the process of adding new cards. Many styling aspects could be adjusted to improve the overall look and feel of the website and present a more polished appearance. For example, I'd like to increase the left and right margins, customize the scrollbars, add animations/transitions, and explore different layouts for the cards.

My drive account is currently stores about 50 GB worth of competition footage of myself and other fencers on the Cornell women's fencing team from this past season. I needed to find a way to transfer the approximately 150 videos off of my drive and into some other kind of storage, but the files were too large to feasibly compress into ZIP files, and I didn't want to tediously find and download each individual video on my drive, one by one. My solution was to use Google's Drive API to write a script that would automatically search through my drive, find the fencing videos, and download them. After reading through some documentation and doing some troubleshooting, I ran the script and successfully found myself with a folder of 150 videos. The script currently has specific search parameters hard-coded in, but I would like to come back and edit the script to take in any given parameters, so that the script can be used to download any particular file(s). It was exciting to see how utilizing some simple coding concepts and an existing API could turn a tedious task into something painless and efficient.
