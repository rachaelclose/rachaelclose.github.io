        <p>Hello! I'm Rachael Close, a Computer Science student at Cornell University, College of Engineering, with a passion for machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. I'm on track to complete my Bachelor of Science in May 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I've been a Dean's List Recipient and immersed myself in courses ranging from Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures to Machine Learning and Computer Vision.</p>
        <p>My technical experiences span across machine learning internships and robotics research, where I've applied my skills in Python, Docker, and various AI technologies to real-world problems. Outside the classroom, I'm an active member of Women in Computing at Cornell and enjoy tennis and figure skating.</p>
