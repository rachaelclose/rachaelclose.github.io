      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Rachael Close (she/her), and I'm an undergrad.</p>
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Rachael Close (she/her), and I'm an undergraduate at Cornell University majoring in
        Computer Science. I am currently a software engineering intern at H2Ok Innovations,
        where I work on machine learning, SQL, and web development projects using React. I have also interned as a
        machine learning intern and a robotics research intern at Cornell University.</p>
      <p>In the past, I have been involved in various research projects and publications. My interests lie in machine
        learning, robotics, and software development, with a strong focus on teaching and mentoring. I am curious about
        the intersections of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and autonomous systems.</p>
      <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy figure skating, rock climbing, playing tennis, and exploring new technologies. I
        also love spending time with family and friends, traveling, and indulging in creative hobbies like painting and
        music.</p>
